Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: `https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/52962/` (link) or `http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:52962`

FLAG: `picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?39dd9e36}`

It is hinted that the website is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. View the source of the page, we will see at the end of the page:

```html
<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->
```

Do the same for the CSS and JavaScript.

At the end of `mycss.css`, we see:

```css
/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */
```

At the end of `myjs.js`, we see:

```javascript
/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?39dd9e36} */
```

Combining the three messages, we have the flag: `picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?39dd9e36}`.
